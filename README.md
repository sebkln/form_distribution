# TYPO3 Form distribution

This TYPO3 extension can be used as a starter kit to configure individual forms with custom templates, all based on the EXT:form Framework which was introduced in TYPO3 v8 LTS.

## Features:
- YAML configuration file with useful adaptions
- basic TypoScript-Setup
- basic and (of course) extendable database table to save form data
- an example form to start with (see below)

## Example form definition:
### Basic contact form
- **EmailToReceiver** finisher
- **Confirmation** finisher
- **SaveToDatabase** finisher
- a new Form prototype to allow customized form templates

More examples (upload form, custom email templates, ...) can be found here:  https://github.com/sebkln/form_examples
